programming-etudes
==================

Simple scripts or programs in various languages to practice certain aspects of
programming languages.  The main reason for this github repository is to
collect these small etudes to look at it at later times.  Also I'm in favour of
studying a new programming language each year.  This years (2014) language is
Javascript.
